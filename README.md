- 👋 Hi, I’m @SamuraiSyntax777, but you can also call me Sam.
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring different areas of programming, with a specific interest in Python and its various applications, including web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, delving deeper into its fundamentals, while also experimenting with various libraries like pandas, numpy and Flask.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python projects, especially those that focus on creating useful scripts, web development, or data-driven projects. If you're also learning or have a project that needs a hand, don't hesitate to reach out! I'm eager to gain real-world experience and contribute to meaningful projects.
